            <h2>Biggest Achievement</h2>
            <p>The biggest achievement made by the U.S. Air Force was the invention of the nuclear bomb. This achievement took place in the US in Los Alamos, New Mexico on the Alamogordo Bombing Range, also known as the Jornada Del Muerto. The creation was hurried as, during World War II, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. After the nuclear bomb was created, it became the first nuke ever made and the US dropped 2 of them in Japan in the towns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After that, Japan decided to give up and retire from the war that the US went on to win with the end of the USSR and the end of Hitler's ruling in Germany.</p>
